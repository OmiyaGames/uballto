# About

[**Uballto**](https://omiyagames.itch.io/uballto) is a phyiscs-based puzzle game created in 72-hours by one individual.  This [Unity](https://unity.com) game was created for the [Ludum Dare 45] challenge, where online attendees were encouraged to make a game based off of the theme, "starting with nothing."

The objective of **Uballto** is to guide the soccer ball to a checkered flag.  The challenge, however, is the player cannot directly interact with either the ball or the flag.  Instead, the player can use their mouse to click-and-drag dialog boxes that not only reveals what the level looks like, but also re-animated mission-critical game elements, such as the aforementioned socer ball, crates, and moving platforms.

For convenience, the soccer ball will automatically roll towards one direction when left on a flat surface (usually, right).
